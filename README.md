# DiskAlgorithms

Simulation of disk access scheduling FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, EDF and FD-SCAN algorithms.

'Disk' in our case is a linearly ordered sequence of blocks numbered from 1 to MAX.

Criterion for assessing algae. will be the sum of disk head movements, as we know, proportional to the order execution time.

It is up to you to formulate the simulation conditions not listed above, i.e.: 'disk' size (number of blocks),
number and method of generating reports (full queue from the beginning? reports in progress? distribution of reports - even,
different?), a way to take into account the handling of real-time requests.
